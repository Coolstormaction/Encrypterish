# Encryption and Decryption program made in python

This is a encryptor and decryptor program made in python.

# Shuffling process

The encryption class takes a letter from the given string, then replaces it to the 3rd letter respectively to the current letter.

# Warning âš 

Not a stable release and not for serious use, working on some bugs and making it more user-friendly to use. \
I will release a v0.0.1 which will the first stable version of Encrypterish. This code is for experimenting purposes and raw. \
More detailed README and pip package coming soon.
